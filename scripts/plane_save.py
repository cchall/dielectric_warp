  """
Saves the particle data and phi to a file just after the 
field solve is finished. The positions and velocities are staggered.
It is automatically called every time step after the field solve
Input:
  - zplane: location where simulations are linked together. Units of meters
            relative to the lab frame. Note grid cell nearest zplane is
            the actual location where data is saved.
  - filename=runid.plane: filename where data is stored
  - js: species which are saved. Defaults to all species. Can be single
        integer or a list of integers.
  - allways_save=false: if set to true, particles and potential are saved
                        at all time step. Default is false: saving starts
                        when first particle cross zplane.
  - deltaz: z grid cell size of simulation where the data will be restored.
            Defaults to w3d.dz, must be an integer multiple of w3d.dz. 
  - deltat: time step size of simulation where the data will be restored.
            Defaults to top.dt. top.dt must be an integer multiple of deltat.
  - newfile=0: When true, creates a new file to save data into, otherwise
               append to file if it already exists.
  - lsavephi=1: When true, saves the potential around the zplane.
  - lsaveparticles=1: When true, save the particles the pass the zplane.
