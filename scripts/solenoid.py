Adds a solenoid element represented as a multipole expansion of the field on

 - ro=ri: outer radius of the sheet (note that only (ri+ro)/2 is actually used)
 - nsheets=1: number of current sheets
 - maxbz: maximum Bz field in T; used to calculate current if specified
 - current: current in the sheet, in units of Ampere-turns/meter; ignored for nonzero maxbz

by ri. The fringelen uses the actual sheet radius.

meaning, and R is the radius of the current sheet. Starting with this
expression, the field off axis is given by the multipole expansion.
